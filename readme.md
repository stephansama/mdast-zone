## What is this?

This package is a utility that lets you find certain comments, then takes the
content between them, and calls a given handler with the result, so that you can
change or replace things.

## When should I use this?

This utility is typically useful when you have certain sections that can be
generated.
Comments are a hidden part of markdown, so they can be used as processing
instructions.
You can use those comments to define what content to change or replace.

A similar package, [`mdast-util-heading-range`][mdast-util-heading-range], does
the same but uses a heading to mark the start and end of sections.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install mdast-zone
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {zone} from 'https://esm.sh/mdast-zone@6'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {zone} from 'https://esm.sh/mdast-zone@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
<!--foo start-->

Foo

<!--foo end-->
```

…and a module `example.js`:

```js
/**
 * @import {Plugin} from 'unified'
 * @import {Root} from 'mdast'
 */

import {zone} from 'mdast-zone'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'

const file = await remark()
  .use(myPluginThatReplacesFoo)
  .process(await read('example.md'))

console.log(String(file))

/** @type {Plugin<[], Root>} */
function myPluginThatReplacesFoo() {
  return function (tree) {
    zone(tree, 'foo', function (start, nodes, end) {
      return [
        start,
        {type: 'paragraph', children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Bar.'}]},
        end
      ]
    })
  }
}
```

…now running `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
<!--foo start-->

Bar.

<!--foo end-->
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`zone`][api-zone].
There is no default export.

### `zone(tree, name, handler)`

Search `tree` for a start and end comments matching `name` and change their
“section” with `handler`.

###### Parameters

* `tree` ([`Node`][node])
  — tree to change
* `name` (`string`)
  — comment name to look for
* `handler` ([`Handler`][api-handler])
  — handle a section

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

### `Handler`

Callback called when a section is found (TypeScript type).

###### Parameters

* `start` ([`Node`][node])
  — start of section
* `nodes` ([`Array<Node>`][node])
  — nodes between `start` and `end`
* `end` ([`Node`][node])
  — end of section
* `info` ([`Info`][api-info])
  — extra info

###### Returns

Results (`Array<Node | null | undefined>`, optional).

If nothing is returned, nothing will be changed.
If an array of nodes (can include `null` and `undefined`) is returned, the
original section will be replaced by those nodes.

### `Info`

Extra info (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

* `parent` ([`Node`][node])
  — parent of the section
* `start` (`number`)
  — index of `start` in `parent`
* `end` (`number`)
  — index of `end` in `parent`

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`Handler`][api-handler] and
[`Info`][api-info].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `mdast-zone@^6`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

Improper use of `handler` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack as the value it returns is injected into the syntax tree.
This can become a problem if the tree is later transformed to **[hast][]**.
The following example shows how a script is injected that could run when loaded
in a browser.

```js
function handler(start, nodes, end) {
  return [start, {type: 'html', value: '<script>alert(1)</script>'}, end]
}
```

Yields:

```markdown
<!--foo start-->

<script>alert(1)</script>

<!--foo end-->
```

Either do not use user input or use [`hast-util-santize`][hast-util-sanitize].
